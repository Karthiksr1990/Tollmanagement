# Tollmanagement
 Design a toll management system.
 
Requirement:
There are multiple tolls across country and each toll has several booths

A Vehicle can be issued 3 type of passes:

Single Day Pass (Can be used only once)

Return Pass (Can be used for return journey on same day)

Seven Day Pass (Can be used as many number of times during 7 days duration)

There are two type of vehicles - 2 wheeler and 4 wheeler




Assumptions

Toll and toll booths creation APIs are already available

Pricing varies as per the vehicle type but is independent of the route

No need to implement database

Vehicle is identified by its registration number




Demonstrations

If a vehicle has a valid pass, let it through

If a vehicle has an invalid pass, display 3 options for passes with prices and let the user choose one and issue the pass

Display leaderboard for each both for sales made in last 1 hour.
